"""Field definitions versus what the API documents.

The catalog carries each operation's request parameters, so a resource's declared
`Field` set can be checked against the real thing without a live space. This is
the gate that keeps them from drifting apart again.

It is a ratchet, not a pass/fail on the whole registry: 31 of 38 writable
resources still differ, and fixing them all at once was not the plan. What these
tests forbid is going backwards — a resource that matches the documentation must
keep matching, and no writable resource may go back to having no fields at all.
