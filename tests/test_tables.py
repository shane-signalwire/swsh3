From the live pass over all 40 listings: the uuid was elided on every wide
resource while short columns were padded out with the spare width, four
different spellings of "a moment in time" appeared across four listings, and
twelve empty collections each drew one row of dashes that reads exactly like a
record whose every field is null.
