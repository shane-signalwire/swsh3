"""The lab: a SIP device and a local AI agent.

Two subsystems that exist to test each other, so the tests are about the seams
between them and the platform: what the device dials, what the agent serves,
what gets created in Call Fabric and — the part that matters most — what gets
deleted again.

Nothing here opens a socket to the internet. The agent is genuinely served and
genuinely fetched over 127.0.0.1, because "does it answer with SWML" is not a
question worth mocking. The SIP call itself is the one thing that cannot be
done in-process (the stack allows one runtime per process), and
`scripts/verify_softphone.py` is the probe that covers it.
