"""Ask the platform which fields a create really needs, then delete what it made.

`scripts/audit_fields.py` compares the registry against the *documented* request
body and reports the drift. That is a report, not a verdict: the spec's required
list is drawn from a shared schema and over-reports badly. It says `sip` is
missing three required fields, yet a SIP endpoint creates fine from a name, a
username and a password. Believing it would mark five fields required that are
not, and every form in the tool would start demanding them.

So this asks the only authority there is. For each resource it sends a create
carrying nothing but the fields the registry already marks required, reads the
422, and reports what the platform named. Anything that succeeds is deleted
again immediately — the point is the error, not the object.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/probe_fields.py --json

This is the companion to `verify_registry.py`: that one proves the routes exist,
this one proves what they will accept. It is the script that turned
`gateways`' three optional fields into three required ones.
