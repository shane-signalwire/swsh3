# Completion is set up on first use rather than asked for. Typing `sw numb<TAB>`

# `--install-completion` is a thing you have to already know exists. pip cannot
# do it: installing a wheel runs no code, so the first interactive run is the
# earliest honest moment.
#
# Three rules keep that from being presumptuous:
#
# - **Only in a real terminal**, read off the streams themselves rather than
#   through `prompts.interactive()`. Whether to *prompt* and whether to *edit
#   someone's shell configuration* are different questions, and tests patch the
#   first one to True all the time to exercise a confirmation. One that did
#   exactly that appended to the developer's real `~/.zshrc`, which is the
#   thing this whole module is supposed not to do.
# - **Once, ever.** The marker is written whatever the outcome — installed,
#   unsupported shell, or failed — so `sw completion uninstall` is final and a
#   shell we cannot detect is not re-probed on every command.
# - **It says what it did.** One line naming the file, and the command that
#   undoes it. A tool that edits your shell configuration in silence is worse
#   than one that does not offer completion at all.
