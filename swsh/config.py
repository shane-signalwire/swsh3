"""Profile storage for swsh.

Resolution order for every credential field, highest priority first:

1. an explicit argument (``--project``, ``--token``, ``--space``)
2. environment variables (``SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_ID`` and friends), including a
   ``.env`` in the current directory
3. the named profile in ``~/.config/swsh/config.toml``

Tokens are stored durably in the config file, which is created 0600 and
re-chmodded on every write, so a profile survives reboots, new terminals and a
flaky or locked OS keyring. Set ``SWSH_USE_KEYRING=1`` to additionally push the
token into the OS keyring; even then the file keeps a copy so retrieval never
depends on the keyring being reachable. Legacy keyring-only profiles are
migrated into the file the first time they resolve successfully.
