"""The selector service — one place that turns "a field is a choice from the
project" into concrete options.

Rule from the plan: never make someone type an identifier swsh can enumerate.
A *from* number, an e911 address, a SIP destination, a template — all are
presented as a list. That list comes from here, and the same implementation
feeds TUI dropdowns, CLI interactive pickers, and shell-completion candidates.

Options are resolved through ``client.invoke`` (so rest and sdk resources both
work) and cached per session, because a picker or a ``<TAB>`` must be instant
and must not hit the API on every keystroke.
