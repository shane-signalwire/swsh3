"""A real SIP phone, inside sw.

Everything else in this tool *describes* calls: it lists them, follows their
routing, watches them arrive. None of it can place one from a SIP endpoint, so
testing an endpoint or an agent meant leaving for a softphone, typing the
credentials in again, and losing the context you had. This module is the
missing half: a registered device that dials, answers, sends DTMF and carries
real audio, driven from the cockpit.

It is `baresip-python` underneath — the baresip SIP stack with an asyncio API
and no system dependencies, since the wheels bundle libre and libbaresip. It is
installed with `sw`.

Nothing here imports it at module import time, and `available()` still answers
whether the stack loaded. Being a dependency is not the same as being present:
the wheels are per-platform, and an environment that could not get one should
say so in one line on the panel rather than take the whole cockpit down with an
ImportError at startup. So every entry point raises `SoftphoneError` naming the
reinstall line instead.

Two things about the design are deliberate:

- **One device, one call.** A test phone that can hold three calls invites a UI
  that has to explain which one a key acts on. `max_concurrent_calls=1` makes
  the stack enforce what the screen assumes.
- **Registration failure is a state, not an exception that unwinds the app.**
  A wrong password is the single most likely thing to happen here, and the
  answer to it is one red line on the panel that says so, with the device still
  there to fix and retry.
