"""Coverage gate: does swsh cover the whole API surface?

Every spec operation (``swsh.spec``) must fall into exactly one bucket:

* **covered** — a registry resource names it in ``rest_ops`` or an extra's
  ``spec_op``, so coverage is exactly what the CLI will actually call
* **excluded** — we will never build it: the Twilio-compat surface (the user
  scoped it out), deprecated dialogflow, and the imperative calling-api command
  channel (surfaced as live call control, not a browsable resource)
* **not-yet** — everything else: the honest build backlog, each entry declared
  in ``BACKLOG`` with a reason

The gate test asserts these three partition the surface exactly, and a ratchet
asserts ``covered`` only ever grows. Building a screen moves its operations from
not-yet to covered and the ratchet is raised — that is what makes "complete
dashboard in a terminal" a checked invariant instead of a claim.

# test_resources.py::TestRestTransportIsComplete), so the registry is the single
