"""The phone: a SIP device and a local AI agent, rendered for the calls view.

This was a screen of its own called the lab, and being its own screen was the
problem. A softphone exists to make a call happen; the thing you want to watch
while it does is the event feed, and that is on the calls view. Two tabs meant
dialling on one and watching on the other, which is the one thing a phone on a
screen is supposed to make possible. So the phone is a panel under the live
calls table now, and `sw sh` has one fewer view.

Nothing in this module talks to anything. It renders `softphone.Softphone` and
`agentlab.AgentLab` state, the way `home.py` renders counts the app fetched, so
the panel cannot be the reason a call is slow.
