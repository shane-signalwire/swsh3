"""Declarative registry of every SignalWire resource swsh can browse and edit.

The platform exposes 21 REST namespaces. Hand-writing a screen and a command set
per namespace would be 21 places to fix the same bug, so each one is described
here as data and generic machinery renders and edits any of them, in both the
TUI and the CLI.

Two deliberate choices about uncertainty:

**Capabilities are introspected, not assumed.** The ``caps`` string on each
resource records which of list/create/read/update/delete the installed SDK
actually implements, taken from the namespace objects themselves. So the TUI
never offers an edit key for a read-only log, and never hides a create that
exists. (Introspection also corrected the reference docs: ``cxml_applications``
does support create, and ``project.tokens`` has no list at all.)

**Every field gets a real control.** Nobody should have to hand-write a JSON
object to tick a box, so each field declares a kind and the form renders the
matching widget: checkboxes for booleans, checkbox groups for sets like SIP
codecs, selects for enumerations, comma-separated inputs for simple lists. The
sole exception is a field whose value genuinely is a document, such as an SWML
script, which gets a validating editor.

Where a set of allowed values may be incomplete, the field is marked
``open_ended`` so extra values can be typed alongside the checkboxes. Nested
payloads are handled by ``path``, letting a flat form produce a nested body.
``columns_for`` likewise falls back to discovered keys, so a wrong guess about
field names degrades to a useful table rather than a wall of dashes.

# ------------------------------------------------------- transport migration
#
# Every resource below moves from the SDK to the spec-driven REST transport.
# The reasons, in order of weight:
#
# * One code path. A resource's routes come from `spec_catalog.json` whether it
#   is a plain CRUD namespace or a surface the SDK never wrapped, so there is a
#   single thing to reason about and a single thing to test.
# * No SDK version coupling. `signalwire-sdk` 3.3.0.dev drops the `compat.*`
#   namespace and ships *fewer* callable methods than 3.0.2. Pinning resource
#   coverage to SDK method presence means a stable 3.1 can silently remove
#   commands. After this, the SDK is reachable only from the RELAY tap in
#   `events/relay_source.py`, which already degrades gracefully on its own.
# * Capabilities become derivable. `caps` can be checked against the spec rather
#   than against whatever happens to be installed.
#
# `caps` letters are deliberately left as they are: they were introspected off a
# live SDK and match what the spec offers. `test_resources.py` now checks them
# against the spec instead of the SDK.
#
# Not migrated, with reasons:
#   cxmlapps  create — the SDK implements it, the spec does not declare it.
#                      Introspection caught this originally (see the module
#                      docstring). Left on the SDK so the capability survives;
#                      revisit when the spec catches up.
#   calls     a live view, not a namespace. No transport.
#   e911 / lookup / mfa / fabres / and the other already-rest resources are
#                      untouched; they were spec-driven from the start.
