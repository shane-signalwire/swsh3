"""Async facade over the SignalWire SDK.

Two things this layer exists to solve.

**Blocking.** ``signalwire.rest.RestClient`` is synchronous and ``requests``
backed. A TUI that called it directly would stall its paint loop, so every SDK
call is dispatched to a thread here.

**Compat encoding.** The SDK sends ``Content-Type: application/json`` to every
endpoint, including the Twilio-compatible LaML surface at
``/api/laml/2010-04-01``. LaML is historically ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``.
Rather than guess, swsh owns its own transport for compat writes and can switch
encoding, with ``probe_compat_encoding()`` settling the question against a live
project using a create-then-delete on a LaML bin, which touches nothing real.
